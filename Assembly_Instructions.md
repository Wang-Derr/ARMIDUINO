# **AR*MID*U*I*NO** Assembly Guide

## Circuit Assembly

### Circuit Schematic

![circuit schematic](images/circuit.png) \
**NOTE** follow this schematic in order to match what is written in the software. If  you prefer to use different pins, you will need to make those same adjustments in the code.

### MIDI Socket Pinout

![MIDI socket](images/midi-labeled.jpg) \
**NOTE** use this image as a reference for the pinout on a MIDI socket. The schematic above matches this pinout description. Since the pins you'll be soldering are on the reverse side, pin 3 will actually be on your right and therefore pin 1 will be on your left.

## Enclosure Assembly

### Components needed

![Step 0](images/step_0.jpg) \
**NOTE** all the parts shown are listed under the **Optional Parts** section in the [README.md](README.md).

### Step 1 - Install 8 of the M3 screws into part #1

![Step 1](images/step_1.jpg)

### Step 2 - Install All 8 15mm M3 standoffs

![Step 2](images/step_2.jpg)

### Step 3 - Grab your Arduino Mega

![Step 3](images/step_3.jpg) \
**NOTE** your Arduino should be completely wired up at this point, so make sure you've tested it before putting it in the enclosure.

### Step 4 - Line up the standoffs on part #1 with the holes on your Arduino Mega

![Step 4](images/step_4.jpg)

![Step 5](images/step_5.jpg) \
**NOTE** this is what it should look like, you may need to twist some of the standoffs so that they fit between the headers on the Arduino Mega.

### Step 5 - Line up the other standoffs on part #1 with the holes on your LCD

![Step 6](images/step_6.jpg)

![Step 7](images/step_7.jpg) \
**NOTE** this is how it should look at this step.

### Step 6 - Install the M3 nuts onto the ends of the standoffs holding your LCD in place

![Step 8](images/step_8.jpg)

### Step 7 - Flip it over and install the 10mm standoffs to the bottom of your Arduino Mega

![Step 9](images/step_9.jpg)

### Step 8 - Install 4 M3 screws into the bottom of part #2

![Step 10](images/step_10.jpg)

### Step 9 - Attach part #2 to the bottom of your Arduino Mega and tighten the M3 screws

![Step 11](images/step_11.jpg)

![Step 12](images/step_12.jpg)

### Step 10 - Slide part #3 into place

![Step 13](images/step_13.jpg) \
**NOTE** make sure that you can pull the MIDI socket out a little bit so that part #3 can go around the wires.

![Step 14](images/step_14.jpg) \
**NOTE** part #3 was designed with the small opening in the bottom of the hold so that the enclosure could be assembled after all the wiring was put in place.

### Step 11 - Attach part #4 to the encoders

![Step 16](images/step_16.jpg)

### Step 12 - Install the nuts onto the encoders to secure them in place

![Step 17](images/step_17.jpg)

### Step 13 - Install part #5

![Step 18](images/step_18.jpg)

### Step 14 - Install part #6

![Step 19](images/step_19.jpg) \
**NOTE** part #6 fits in on the front of case.

### Step 15 - Install Part #7

![Step 20](images/step_20.jpg)

![Step 21](images/step_21.jpg)

### Step 16 - Install Part #8

![Step 22](images/step_22.jpg)

### Step 17 - Install Part #9

![Step 23](images/step_23.jpg)

![Step 24](images/step_24.jpg)

### Step 18 - Install the caps for the encoders

![Step 25](images/step_25.jpg)

### If it all fits together, apply superglue or your preferred 3D print bonding method to hold it all together

**NOTE** you're going to want to test it all before permanently sealing it together. I would also recommend not sealing the bottom panel (part #2) to the rest of the enclosure since it's already held in place by the M3 screws.
